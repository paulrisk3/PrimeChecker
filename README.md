# PrimeChecker

This program takes a user-given integer and calculates its primeness (that is, if the integer is prime or not).

I enjoy writing in C++, but my job for the past year has had me writing in PHP. This project is just to brush up on my skills and to prepare me to take on bigger things.

I got the idea for this project from a job interview question I faced several months ago. The interviewer asked me to present a basic algorithm to find if a number is prime or not. I gave a fairly weak answer, and it's bugged me to this day. So I am writing this program in order to better understand primr numbers and their properties.
